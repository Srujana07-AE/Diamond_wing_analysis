## Project Overview
This repository contains the results and setup details for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of **supersonic flow over a double-wedged airfoil**.  
The simulation was performed using **ANSYS Fluent** to analyze the pressure and velocity distributions around the airfoil at **Mach 3**.

The study focuses on:
- Capturing shock waves and expansion fans generated by the double-wedge geometry.
- Understanding pressure and velocity variations across the surface.
- Assessing the effect of mesh refinement on solution accuracy.

##  Results

The results include:

- **Pressure Contours**  
  Visualizing high-pressure regions near shock waves and low-pressure regions near expansion fans.

- **Velocity Contours**  
  Showing acceleration through expansion and deceleration across shocks.
